1) Add the necessary code to the function category_list located in the file
app/category.py so that it display all the data in the category table.

2) Add the necessary code to the function category_create_save located in
the file app/category.py so that it insert a new record to the category table.

3) Modify the query in the function product_list in the file app/product.py so
that it the result also includes the category name for each product.

#IMPORTANT: remember to stop and restart the run.py whenever you make a change to the code. The flask server needs to reload the code everytime a change is made.
#Also, only one person in the breakout room should start the run.py file because only one website can be hosted at port 5000
